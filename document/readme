PoultryDetect+ : PoultryDetect  Transfer Learning-Based Classification of Poultry Diseases for Enhanced Health Management 
=======================================================================

Project Description:
--------------------
PoultryDetect+ is a web-based AI application designed to assist poultry farm owners, veterinary students, and researchers in identifying poultry diseases from images, providing suggested medicines, symptoms, and generating downloadable reports. The application also offers a training and research hub with veterinary guidelines and AI resources.

Features:
---------
✔ Upload images to predict poultry diseases  
✔ Display prediction percentage and related symptoms  
✔ Suggest appropriate medicines for identified conditions  
✔ Download diagnosis reports as PDF  
✔ Access veterinary research case studies and guidelines  
✔ AI training tutorials for students  
✔ Consistent modern UI using Tailwind CSS  
✔ Logo and images for visual branding  
✔ Copyright footer on every page

Project Structure:
------------------
/static/                 -> Images, logos, CSS files  
/templates/              -> HTML template files (index.html, result.html, about.html, etc.)  
app.py                   -> Main Flask application  
/venv/                    -> Virtual environment (if used)  
requirements.txt         -> Python dependency list  
README.md                -> Project description file (this file)

How to Run:
-----------
1. Install required packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Year: 2025  
Purpose: Veterinary research and practical AI application for poultry farming

Notes:
------
- Ensure all image files are placed inside the 'static' folder.
- The AI model should be loaded and integrated within 'app.py'.
- Update URLs in HTML templates if deploying online.
- Keep consistent image naming and file formats as referenced in HTML.
